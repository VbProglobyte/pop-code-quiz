                 <p>This quiz will test your knowledge in code ( <em>specifically javaScript</em> ), but it     is timed. Don't take too long to answer, or the timer will run out and you will have to     start over. <em>What a pity.</em> Answer incorrectly, and the timer will be deducted -10    seconds. <em>What an extreme pity.</em> Try not to worry about the timer though. I have a  feeling you will do great... so grab a cup of <em>java,</em> and let's begin!
